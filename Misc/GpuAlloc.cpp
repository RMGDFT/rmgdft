// Since cudamalloc is very slow we grab a large buffer of GPU ram
// at initialization time and use GpuMalloc to return pointers into
// it. This is not a sophisticated allocater. One must know how much
// gpu memory the program needs at compile time and set the initial 
// block size large enough. Also blocks must be allocated and freed
// in FIFO fashion. Considering the way that RMG uses GPU memory
// at the present time with a few large blocks in subdiag this is 
// not a serious restriction.
